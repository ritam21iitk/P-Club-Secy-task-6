**Problem statement:**

Ashiq is very interested in relationships, so after so many studies about them, he gets a trick to know the relationship between two persons. His trick is as follows:

Step 1: Write down the first names of two persons like a numerator and a denominator and a functional bar between them

Step 2: If there is/are any same letter(s) in the numerator and the denominator, just cancel them

Step 3: Count the total number of remaining letters (which are not canceled out) both from the numerator and the denominator and assume it as x

Step 4: Write F L R M on your page and start counting from the left and eliminate the xth term, if x is greater than 4 then go to 1st term again and assume the term after the last term to find the xth element. Eliminate the xth term and continue the process for 3 terms in similar way and for 2 terms also do this. At last, you will have only one letter.

Whatever remains is the result. Where F stands for friendship, L stands for one-sided love, R stands for relationship and M stands for married.

Now Ashiq has come to you to code these steps where two first names will be there as input and output should be their relationship status.

Only the first names will be given. Names should be written in small letters (for the beginning also).

A name can contain a minimum of 2 letters and a maximum of 50 letters.

**Input format:**

Two space-separated first names will be there as input.

All characters will be small letters.

2<= No. of the letters in any name<50

**Output format:**

Kind of their relationship. Like-

Friendship

Or,

One-sided love

Or,

Relationship

Or,

Married
